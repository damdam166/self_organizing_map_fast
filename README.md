# SELF ORGANIZING MAP - LINEAR TOPOLOGY + ONE INPUT VECTOR + MATPLOTLIB

## Repository


You will find the implementation and the tests in the `src` directory.


## EXECUTION


The file `src/som.py` plots the Matplotlib graph of the map for each iteration of the algorithm.

If there are 100 iterations, there will be 100 graphs.
